Exploratory data analysis is the process of understanding a new dataset by looking at the data, constructing graphs, tables, and models. We want to understand three aspects:

1. each individual variable by itself;

2. each individual variable in the context of other, relevant, variables; and

3. the data that are not there.


Descriptive statistics and graphical methods support the following process:

1. Understand the distribution and properties of individual variables.

2. Understand relationships between variables.

3. Understand what is not there.
